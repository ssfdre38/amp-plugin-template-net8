### Historical Note

created for and is now owned by Barrer Software.

## Statement Regarding Recent Events

This code was originally created to help the CubeCoders AMP community by providing 
an updated .NET 8 plugin template. Unfortunately, our contribution was rejected by 
CubeCoders staff.

### Apology to Mike Rihan (CubeCoders)

We sincerely apologize to Mike Rihan and the CubeCoders team for any confusion or 
inconvenience. Our intent was genuinely to help the AMP community. We understand 
that there may have been company policies or considerations we were not aware of.

We hold no ill will toward you or the majority of the CubeCoders staff. The rejection 
of our contribution does not reflect on your leadership or vision for AMP.

### Regarding James (IceOfWraith)

However, we must acknowledge that the handling of this situation by James (IceOfWraith) 
was unprofessional and created unnecessary hostility. The dismissal of a community 
contribution with references to "previous legal threats" was inappropriate and harmful 
to community relations.

To James: Your actions toward Daniel (ssfdre38/ssfdre38-hue) and by extension Barrer 
Software have been consistently negative. We hope you can reflect on how you interact 
with community members who are genuinely trying to help.

## Going Forward

Barrer Software will continue to create tools for the community. All our work will be:
- Properly copyrighted and attributed
- Licensed for community use (typically MIT License)
- Protected against unauthorized appropriation
- Made available to developers who need modern tools
